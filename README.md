# Paper Trading App - Stonks
Stonks is an app designed with a goal to let people learn how to trade stocks with zero risk to lose money. In this app you can buy and sell real world stocks with virtual money.

The app takes in a stock symbol, volume and current price, checks if you have enough money available on your account, and creates a position, while reducing your account balance. WHen you close a position, it 'sells' the stocks with a current price and updates your balance.


## Technologies Used
* HTML5
* JavaScript
* Bootstrap 4
* React-bootstrap
* ReactJS
* Axios
* Alpha Vantage (3rd party API)
* Ruby on Rails back end

I used React for the App`s structure, creating multiple dynamically updating components that render data from both my back and and a third party API.
To connect front end to the back end and make API calls, I used axios.
To add better structure and UX, I used React Bootstrap.

 ## Future Features
 - Dinamically update chart with real time data
 - Display profit/loss for total portfolio as well as for each position

 ## Process, Planning, Problem-Solving
 I started the project with brainstorming the back end structure. I researched a few existing stock market apps to determine what is a must-have in my own app. Then I created ERD for my future DataBase and moved to front end planning.
 For my front end I created a wireframe with AdobeXD, where I layed out all the vital element of the app.
 After finishing the planning steps, I moved to developing the back end. More details on that in my API README.

 Then I built the main REACT components for my front end and connected them to the back end with AXIOS calls. When this step was done, I integrated my app to a third party stock market API and displayed the fetched data on the front end with a chart.

 After these steps were successfully completed, I started to test my app for various bugs.
